        <p>I have more than three years of experience as a full stack developer and most recently as a
            native cross-platform app developer. So far i have successful launched projects to production using programming
            languages like Python, JavaScript, Dart, Ruby on Rails with frameworks like Django, React, React-native,
            Flutter, Shopify's Liquid etc.</p>
        <p>I believe that the ability to continously test the boundaries of my knowledge and skills as a developer is paramount to
            improving what i am able to offer my employers. That's why i religiously cultivate the habit of personally
            buying and consuming courses online to learn the latest and best technologies out there, taking on
            projects that require me to learn and pick up new skills on the go!</p>
        <p>So far in my career as a developer, every i have worked with and for knows me as someone who isn't afraid to take on any
            task, regardless of the complexity and still get the job done. I have a background in Mechanical
            Engineering which accounts for my logical aproach to challenges, I am great at breaking down
            complex situations into smaller manageable components, It is what has consistently helped improve the quality of apps i develop, increase my
            efficiency and significantly improve the productivity of my employers.</p>
        <p>I love software development and all that it comes with. It's something that i would do even if i wasn't
            getting paid to do it</p>
